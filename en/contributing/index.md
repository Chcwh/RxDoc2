# Contributing
Here are some pointers for anyone looking for mini-features and work items that would make a positive contribution to ReactiveUI.

* Let us know if (and how) [you are using ReactiveUI in production](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/979).
* We keep [a bunch of curated tasks specifically for new contributors](https://github.com/reactiveui/reactiveui/labels/up-for-grabs), which are a great way to get started with open source and provide a fantastic avenue for getting to know the ReactiveUI maintainers.
* Write a blog post about `#ReactiveUI` and then [tweet the link to our twitter account](https://twitter.com/ReactiveXUI). We will retweet you.
* Contribute [a repro case](https://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Debugging_the_Code-The_Anatomy_of_a_Good_Bug_Report.html) or [help resolve known issues](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues?q=is%3Aopen).
* Help flesh out and [improve our documentation](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/pull/771) by providing [content writing](https://jacobian.org/writing/what-to-write/), [structure enforcement](https://jacobian.org/writing/technical-style/) or [editing](https://jacobian.org/writing/editors/) services.

We try not to be too OCD about coding style wars, but we do [have our own convention](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [best design practices documented](https://github.com/reactiveui/rxui-design-guidelines) - please respect them and your pull-request experience will be much smoother. If you are using Visual Studio, please [install the rebracer plugin](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/410e9b9f-65f3-4495-b68e-15567e543c58) which will automatically apply the correct source formatting settings.
