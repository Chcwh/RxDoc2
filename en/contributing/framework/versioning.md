# Versioning

Never bump the version numbers as part of a pull-request, it is done via the project maintainer after merge.

    michaelteper [10:49 AM]  @paulcbetts: confirm that .nuspec lists
    Splat 1.6.0 so we should be good to push out 6.4.1

    paulcbetts [10:49 AM]  :cool:

    michaelteper [10:56 AM]  @paulcbetts: would it help for me to
    include version bump in the PR?

    paulcbetts [10:56 AM]  Nah that's easy

    ghuntley [10:57 AM]  so what's the rule of thumb anyway for
    version bumps? Never do it in the PR?

    paulcbetts [11:03 AM]  I always do it

    paulcbetts [11:03 AM] Because it's an annoying manual process
    without some Clever Tricksâ„¢

    michaelteper [11:03 AM]  it would seem "bad" on principle, in case
    one doesnt want to pull a PR into a release or pull another one
    ahead of it...
