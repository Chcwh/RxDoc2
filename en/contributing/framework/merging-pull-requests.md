We use [GitReleaseManager](https://gitreleasemanager.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) to automatically generate our release notes as per [configured in this file](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/develop/GitReleaseManager.yaml). By doing a little bit of leg work here it makes creating a release so much easier. You will need to assign one or more labels to categorize what component of ReactiveUI was changed by this unit of work.
