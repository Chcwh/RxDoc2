# Merging Pull Requests

Assign the GitHub issue to the `vNext` milestone.

We use [GitReleaseManager](https://gitreleasemanager.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) to automatically generate our release notes as per [configured in this file](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/develop/GitReleaseManager.yaml). By doing a little bit of leg work here it makes creating a release so much easier. 

1. Assign one or more labels to categorize what component of ReactiveUI was changed by this unit of work. ![](/images/contributing/apply-one-or-more-labels.png)

2. Rename the title of the GitHub issue to match our convention. ![Ren](/en/images/contributing/rename-the-title.png)
