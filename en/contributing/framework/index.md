# Framework

We try not to be too OCD about coding style wars, but we do [have our own convention](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [best design practices documented](https://github.com/reactiveui/rxui-design-guidelines) - please respect them and your pull-request experience will be much smoother. If you are using Visual Studio, please [install the rebracer plugin](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/410e9b9f-65f3-4495-b68e-15567e543c58) which will automatically apply the correct source formatting settings.


## Code Formatting
Install https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/410e9b9f-65f3-4495-b68e-15567e543c58 which will detect https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/Rebracer.xml and make everyone happier.
