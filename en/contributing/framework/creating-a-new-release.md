# Creating A New Release

## Development

Once pull-requests have been merged into `develop` a new release is automatically generated and published to our [MyGet feed](myget-feed.md). There is nothing you need to do.

The version number is [automatically incremented](semantic-versioning.md) based upon our GitVersion configuration.
