# Functional Reactive Programming

Functional. Reactive. Programming. What on Earth is that?

Well, we know to some degree what functional programming is. Functions don't have side-effects; there's no mutable state. It's a difficult way to program since the real world is mutable. Modelling things like user input becomes a nightmare.

Reactive programming? What's that? Well, the best way to describe reactive programming is to think of a spreadsheet. Imagine three cells, A, B, and C. A is defined as the sum of B and C. Whenever B or C changes, A reacts to update itself. That's reactive programming: changes propagate throughout a system automatically.

Functional reactive programming is just a combination of functional and reactive paradigms. We model user input as a function that changes over time, abstracting away the idea of mutable state.

Functional reactive programming is the peanut butter and chocolate of programming paradigms.

At the core of functional reactive programming is a signal. A signal is a rather abstract concept, and it's easier to describe what a signal does rather than what it is. A signal simply sends values over time. It sends values until it either completes, or errors out, at which point it stops sending values forever. A signal either completes or errors out, but not both.

Signals have no sense of a "current value" or "past values" or "future values", they are very simple. They just send values over time. Signals become useful when they're subscribed to or used with bindings, both cases of which we'll cover shortly. For now, it's important to understand that a signal can be transformed.

If I have a signal that sends numbers, and I want it to send strings instead, I can easily transform that signal with a map. A map is an operator that takes in a signal as a receiver, performs some operation on the values sent over that signal, and generates a new signal with the new, mapped values.

A signal can be subscribed to in order to perform side-effects. A good example would be the signal emitted by a button when it's pressed; we can subscribe to that signal in order to perform side effects. A signal can also be bound to a property. For example, a signal that sends the location of a gesture recognizer can be mapped to a color and bound to the background color of a view. Then, when the user changes their tap position, the view changes color.

Both of these examples, of subscription and binding, demonstrate that we can create a set up at the beginning of an application runtime and tell the code *what to do* without telling it *how to do it*. This is the value of functional reactive programming.

Another core concept in functional reactive programming is that of *derived* state. State is OK in ReactiveUI, as long as it's *bound* to a signal. This derived state means that you never explicitly set the value of a bound property, but rather rely on signal transformations to derive that state for you.
