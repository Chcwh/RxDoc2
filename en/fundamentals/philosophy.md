# Our Philosophy

This is a set of rules and guidelines standing behind the framework design choices.

## No setup

The setup of an app should be as easy as possible. Things should Just Workâ„¢ out of the box.

## Buffet Table

You can select only the pieces of the framework you like and build on them. You can mix ReactiveUI with other frameworks and libraries to your liking.

## Testability

You should be able to test your ViewModels. Stuff like schedulers and routing should not be an excuse for not writing unit tests. Framework should support mocking them easily.

## Splat dependency

[Splat](https://github.com/paulcbetts/splat) is an amazing library specifically developed with mobile devices in mind. Don't be afraid to use it.
