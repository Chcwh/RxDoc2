# ReactiveUI Documentation

ReactiveUI is a [MVVM](fundamentals/model-view-viewmodel.md) framework that allows you to use the [Reactive Extensions](fundamentals/reactive-extensions.md) for .NET to create elegant, testable User Interfaces that run on any mobile or
desktop platform.

> **Warning** This book is a work in progress. Eventually it will contain the entire documentation for the ReactiveUI project.

Until this book is complete, you can find additional documentation in [the main repository](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/tree/docs/docs). Those documents are being successively ported into this book.

You are more than welcome to help us build this documentation. We encourage you to get started by checking out our [contribution guidelines](contributing/index.html).
