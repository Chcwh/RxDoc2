# Support

ReactiveUI is an open source project that is community supported by people just like you. We keep [a bunch of curated tasks specifically for new contributors](https://github.com/reactiveui/reactiveui/labels/up-for-grabs) which are [a great way to get started with open source](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/). They also provide a fantastic avenue for getting to know the ReactiveUI maintainers.

If you have a question, please see if any discussions in our [GitHub issues](github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactiveui) have already answered it. If not, please [feel free to file your own](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/new)! 

We have our very own [Slack organization](https://reactivex.slack.com/) which contains some of the best user interface/reactive extension developers in the industry. All software engineers, young and old, regardless of experience are welcome to join our campfire but you'll need to send an email to [ghuntley@ghuntley.com](mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com) with the Email address you'd like to be invited, and we'll send you an invite. Sit tight, it's worth it.
